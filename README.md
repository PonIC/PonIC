PonIC: Pig on Input Contracts
=============================

Description
------------
This is an initial prototypical implementation of PonIC, an integration of Apache Pig and Stratosphere.
	

Configuration
--------------

In the file conf/pig.properties, you need to set the following parameters:
- `pig.stratosphere.path` : the path where to store PactPlan-related information
- `pig.pactplan.filepath` : the path where to store PigContext-related information
- `pig.context.filepath` : the location of the PactClient to use


Build with
-----------
`ant` in the home directory. After build, you need to manually copy `PigPlanAssemblerExt.class` in the directory which is the root directory of the jar that is created to be submitted to Nephele (this is the Pig root directory at the moment)


Run with
---------
`./bin/pig -x strato` in Pigâ€™s root directory


Current Capabilities
---------------------
The system at its present state does not support neither the full set of Pig Latin operators nor all capabilities of the Apache Pig system. It is an proof-of-concept implementation, still under development, which will be gradually extended to support all Pig features. We list here the supported operations and existing restrictions:

### Currently Supported Operators
* `LOLoad`
* `LOStrore`
* `LOFilter`
* `LOJoin` (2 inputs)
* `LOCoGroup` (1-2 inputs)
* `LOCross` (2 inputs)

### Restrictions
* We assume input from files, containing one record per line, with whitespace fields, without any type information (all fileds are currently considered `bytearray` / `PactString` respectively).
* Only one `STORE` operator is allowed per script.
* In `(co)Group` only the `REGULAR` type is currently supported and grouping can only be performed by field (not tuples or expressions)
* All `JOIN` operations are currently considered inner joins and the strategy cannot be manually (merge, skewed, replicated) specified. It is chosen automatically.
